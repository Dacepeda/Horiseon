# HORISEON CODE REFRACTING WEEKLY CHALLENGE!

## Being tasked with refracting this assignment, I was motivated to apply what I had learned so far and fix the issues for this weeks challenge. The reason why? to be able to recognize incorrect semantics and not applying the ***"D.R.Y"*** Rule, Don't Repeat Yourself. Cleaning up code and making it easier to read and for future developers to hit the ground runnnig when future editing takes place. Failure to abide will only create future issues.
